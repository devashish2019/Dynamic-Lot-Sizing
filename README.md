# Dynamic-Lot-Sizing

This is a python implementation of the famous dynamic lot sizing algorithm

1. The implementation follows a network optimization approach of finding the lowest cost path (total cost of satisfying demand), given the deterministic demand over a finite time horizon

2. Many nuances have been added to the model to make it more realistic. This includes adding manixum and minimum inventory carrying capacities, maximum production capacities etc.
